# Void Stranger Game Recreation

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

## CS50 Final Project

This repository contains my CS50 final project: a recreation of the game "Void Stranger" created by System Erasure using Lua and the LÖVE framework. Although I have never played the original game, I was inspired by its unique mechanics after watching a playthrough on YouTube. The project focuses on implementing the core mechanics, while keeping in mind posibility for scaling it.
